Simply put: the proficiency bonus in Dungeons and Dragons is a bonus added to skill checks, saving throws, or attacks for skills that a character is proficient in. At first glance, it might not be obvious how this bonus differs from the ability modifiers a character has.

The key difference is that the bonus only applies in select cases. While an intelligence modifier will get added anytime that character is doing something that requires intelligence, a proficiency bonus is only added if that character has added proficiency for the specific skill or tool required. This means that the character either has a natural talent with this particular action due to their class and race or that they’ve spent extra time training and leveling up this skill.

For example, a rogue will have a natural proficiency with thieves’ tools while a Bard would have a natural instinct for musical instruments. In a battle of the bands between the two, the bard is going to have an advantage. In a high stakes heist scenario, the rogue is going to have the advantage.

For the purpose of the game, you express that unique advantage as the proficiency bonus. This is a specific number of points that will get added to the player’s throw any time they are doing something that their character is uniquely proficient in.
