Learning about Instrictlab by playng DnD

A little about myself :

When I’m not a father who loves playing 🤡 with his daughter;

When I’m not a husband who likes to cook 👨‍🍳 for his family;

When I’m not a DataScientist 👨‍💻 at IBM working with our clients to bring them the more tailored solution 🎯 to their need;

When I’m not a 4th Dan black belt 🥋 of Kendo who help others and himself to progress;

I’m a Geek 🎮 🎲 who enjoys playing board games and video games. 
More recently I’ve really appreciated the work of ZeniMax Online Studios on the 10th year anniversary of TheElderScrollsOnline game. The developers, writers and artists created through the years amazing stories and game mechanics with proper attention to details which time to time is closer to a movie than a video game. I would like to compliment all the people behind the Elsweyr chapter, so far my favorite one. 

In that game I played as a Healer 👨‍⚕️ ⛑ , the one who help other by healing them and by having an overview of what is happening.

We are the sum of our experience plus all the progress we help other to reach, that’s why I’m always happy to “give a hand”.
